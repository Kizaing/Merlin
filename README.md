2. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/Kizaing/Merlin/releases) of the plugin. 
3. Drop the Jester.dll file in the `plugin` folder of your Impostor server.
4. To play with your client on your private server, see the instructions on the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) page.
5. Don't forget to open chat before you start a game! :wink:

## How it works

## Credits

- All the developers and contributors to the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) project.
- Massive thank you to [Martii](https://github.com/Maartii/Jester) this is very much a shameless rip off of their code. We had an idea to create a new role that operated similar to the Jester so we built on the base of that existing project :)
